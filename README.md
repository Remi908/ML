## Description:

The report below elaborates on the approach and findings of the time-series forecasting project using an MLP model. The objective of the project was to forecast future values based on historical data. Much emphasis was placed on the performance optimization of the model by use of manual tuning of hyperparameters. The trajectories in the dataset were divided into training, validation, and test sets to learn the patterns from the model effectively. It was mainly aimed at the selection of the best hyperparameters, training the model on them, and testing its performance on unseen data.
